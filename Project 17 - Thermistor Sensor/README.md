# Thermistor Sensor

![alt text](thermistor-sensor.png "Thermistor Sensor")

A thermistor can sense the temperature change of surroundings in real time. In this project, it will convert the temperature variation into voltage, and input the voltage to the micro:bit. Finally, the result will be displayed on the serial monitor.  

**Note:** This project uses the Arduino IDE.

## Required Components
Quantity | Component
--- | ---
1 | micro:bit
1 | T-type adapter
1 | USB cable
1 | Thermistor sensor (green)
1 | 10KÎ© resistor
1 | Breadboard
3 | Jumper wire

## Coding the micro:bit

Create or download the hex file, power up the unit & upload the code. Open the Arduino IDE, set the COM port shown below. Then, open serial monitor & set the baud rate as 115200. You should begin to see the value output from the thermistor.
